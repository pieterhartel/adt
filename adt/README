README

To compile the adt tool unpack the tarball and type make.
There are a few warnings about missing previous declarations but
these can be ignored.

The last step of the compilation runs adt on its own specification
and compares the output to that provided in the tar ball. There should
not be any differences for the test.

adt has been tested under linux and cygwin.
